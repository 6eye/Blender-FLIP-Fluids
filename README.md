# Blender FLIP Fluids

**FLIP Fluids** is a powerful liquid simulation plugin that gives you the ability to create high quality fluid effects all within [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), the free and open source 3D creation suite. Created by Ryan Guy and Dennis Fassbaender.

## FLIP Fluids Beta

The core fluid engine, a FLIP-based fluid solver, has been under development for over three years with over a year of development focused on tightly integrating the simulator into Blender as an addon. We are excited to announce that the **FLIP Fluids simulator** is now ready to enter a beta testing phase! **The beta will begin on February 13th**.

<h3>Whitewater Generation</h3>
Create awesome large scale fluid effects with the whitewater simulator. Generate and simulate millions of foam, bubble, and spray particles to give a sense of realism to large bodies of water.

<h3>Built-in Mesh Generation</h3>
The built-in mesher generates highly detailed meshes so that your fluid surface is render-ready immediately after simulation. This mesh generator is memory efficient and able to produce meshes containing millions of triangles without requiring massive amounts of RAM.

<h3>Excellent User Experience</h3>
The addon interface was designed with a focus on functionality and usability to create a comfortable workflow. View simulation progress, meshes, and statistics in real-time. Pause and resume simulation baking- even after a Blender crash. Create and manage your own preset settings. Quickly apply materials from the fluid material library.
